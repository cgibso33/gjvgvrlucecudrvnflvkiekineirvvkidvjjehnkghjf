## 48097711

A collection of reddit programming challeneges from [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/search?q=%23&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=week).

## 93102613

A colleciton of personal pet projects, created for one reason or another.

1. GitHierarchyGenerator
   * Responsible for generating that nifty tree-esk illustration of a folder's contents.
   * Interprets a `.gitignore` file, if found at the directory's root, and ignores files that would be ignored by git.
2. LazyPermutationIterator
   * A Java implmenentation of the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter permutation generation algorithm.
   * Contains a `main.java` class with example usage, and is (decently) documented.
3. MonitorSizeCalculator
   * A Python implementation of a simple calculation that determines optimal monitor dimensions for so-called "matching" monitors, and the Pixels-Per-Inch disparity between two monitors, when provided with their respective dimensions.
   * Code is wholly undocumented, but contains an associated PDF detailing the methods used and the rationale behind each.
