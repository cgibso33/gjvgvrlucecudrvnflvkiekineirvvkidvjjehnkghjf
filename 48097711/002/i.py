create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name. The
text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e,
i, etc.").
for extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail,
or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces. These will
be tested rigorously!
For super extra credit, code it in C
